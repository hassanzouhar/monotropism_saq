# Monotropism Questionnaire (MQ)

This project is a web-based implementation of the Monotropism Questionnaire (MQ), a research-validated instrument designed to measure a monotropic cognitive style. It was developed by autistic scholars and is based on the theory of monotropism.

This application provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for individuals to take the questionnaire, receive a score, and understand their results in the context of recent research.

## Features

- **Interactive Questionnaire:** A 47-item questionnaire with a user-friendly, multi-step interface.
- **Progress Tracking:** Visual indicators for overall and section-specific progress.
- **Detailed Results:** Calculates an overall monotropism score and a profile across eight distinct factors.
- **Score Interpretation:** Provides context and interpretation for the scores based on the validation study (Garau et al., 2023).
- **Contextual Information:** Includes background on monotropism theory and important considerations for interpreting the results.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience across different devices.

## Tech Stack

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Lucide React:** A library of simply designed, beautiful icons.
